<p>for cinnamon rolls — soft and warm</p>
<p>from the oven and drizzled with icing.</p>
<p>We'll show you step by step how to make</p>
<p>cinnamon rolls from scratch — from making</p>
<p>the dough to filling, forming, baking,</p>
<p>and icing — with loads of helpful tips along the way.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dough:</li>
        <li>1 cup warm milk (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>2 eggs, room temperature</li>
        <li>⅓ cup margarine, melted</li>
        <li>4 ½ cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 ½ teaspoons bread machine yeast</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Filling:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>2 ½ tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>⅓ cup butter, softened</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Icing:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ½ cups confectioners' sugar</li>
                <li>¼ cup butter, softened</li>
                <li>1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Directions</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare dough: Place milk, eggs, margarine, flour, salt, white sugar, and yeast in the pan of a bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select dough cycle; press Start.</li>
                    <li>When dough has doubled in size, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Cover it with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rest for 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a 16x21-inch rectangle.</li>
                    <li>Prepare filling: Combine brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Spread softened butter over the dough, then sprinkle cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly over top.</li>
                    <li>Starting at the longer end, roll up the dough; cut into 12 rolls. Place rolls in a lightly greased 9x13-inch baking pan. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>While rolls are baking, prepare icing: Beat confectioners' sugar, butter, cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and salt until creamy.</li>
                    <li>Spread icing on warm rolls before serving.</li>
                </ol>
