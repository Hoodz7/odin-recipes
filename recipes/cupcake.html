            <li>2 cups sugar</li>        
            <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>        
            <li>4 large eggs</li>        
            <li>cup sour cream</li>        
            <li>½ cup milk</li>        
            <li>1 (1 ounce) bottle McCormick® Red Food Color</li>        
            <li>2 teaspoons McCormick® Pure Vanilla Extract</li>                
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 30 muffin cups with paper liners.</li>        
                <li>Make cake: Mix together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl; set aside.</li>
                <li>Beat sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Mix in sour cream, milk, food color, and vanilla. Gradually beat in flour mixture on low speed until just blended; do not overbeat. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a cupcake comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in the pans on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Remove cupcakes from the pans; cool completely.</li>
                <li>While cupcakes are cooling, make frosting: Beat cream cheese, butter, sour cream, and vanilla extract in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar until smooth.</li>
                <li>Spread or pipe frosting onto cooled cupcakes.</li>
            </ol>
